  <h1>How I Managed Internships in High School</h1>

  <p>People think high school is just classes and exams. For me, it was also about building my lane — and that meant internships.</p>

  <p>I started off raw. I had no connections, no resume — just skills and the drive to build something real. My first internship was in <strong>AI/ML</strong>, and I had to learn how to balance code with school deadlines and burnout.</p>

  <p>So how did I manage?</p>

  <ul>
    <li>🧠 <strong>Strict scheduling:</strong> I planned weekends like a CEO. 2 hours for research, 3 hours for tasks, and gym before bed.</li>
    <li>💼 <strong>Cold emailing:</strong> I didn’t wait for offers. I pitched myself like I was already the solution.</li>
    <li>📊 <strong>Portfolio power:</strong> I made pages that *looked* clean AF — even if the backend was still under construction (like this one 😉).</li>
    <li>🤖 <strong>Built value:</strong> Whether it was ComputeX or project managing small AI tasks, I always gave more than I got.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Now I use these same skills for every side quest — from music production to tinkering with bots. Internships gave me my blueprint, but it was how I managed them that defined me.</p>

  <p><i>This is just one part of the story. The grind continues...</i></p>
