  <h1>projects & people</h1>
  <p>managing different projects at once is not as easy as it sounds. some days it feels like there’s always one more task, one more deadline, one more thing to fix. it’s a slow shuffle between what needs to be done now and what can wait. sometimes, both feel urgent.</p>
  
  <p>on top of that, there’s the noise of what others expect from you. be quicker, be better, be everywhere. i’ve realised it’s better to keep that at arm’s length. the reason i started these projects was to build something meaningful, not to match someone else’s idea of progress.</p>
  
  <p>so i’m taking it step by step. finishing one small part of a website. drafting a section of code. making a plan for the next week. it’s not fast, but it’s steady. and right now, steady is enough.</p>
  
  <p>that’s it for today. there’s still a lot left to do, but i think i’m moving in the right direction. one piece at a time.</p>
