  <p>it's been quite a while since i wrote on this. to be exact, 8 months ago, i was stuck and worried as to where i would end up in cause of my ass grades in 11th. as they say, life's a beach(no pun intended). fortunately, through many triumphs and findings, i did many things this year that im grateful for-joining a robotics team, meeting an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-saweras/">ambitious yet friendly canadian arab guy</a>, writing a hell lot of essays, controlling emotions during college decisions and exams, grinding extracurriculars and constant burnout after that.</p>
  
  <p>now, lifes slowly starting to wrap up. atleast my 14 years of school life are coming to a close and now in a month, the hell begins-boards then college decisions then farewell then ap exams then that ielts tutoring i signed up for then boards results then ap results then india exams(vit exam and the ugee exam) and so on and so forth. this time i will be more burnt out than when i did my ec's. and things will turn out more different than before. maybe for the better or for the worse.</p>
  
  <p>so i’m taking it all in one last time. just like in the final scene of young sheldon when sheldons next chapter of life had begun when he went to caltech and then the big bang theory happened. but im definitely grateful to some people, not all who helped me keep my head up-my physics teacher(snehil sir), my math teacher(vaidehi maam), my cs teacher(richi maam), my chemistry teacher(rukmani maam), my guidance counsellors, internship instructors, my friends-kaushik, mritunjay, nathan, andrew, krishanth and the ftc team. and definitely my parents and grandparents, my gurus. i guess thats it for the most part.</p>

  <p>that’s it for today. there’s still a lot left to do, but i think i’m moving in the right direction. i said this already before in my last blog post but yea this stays true for next chapter of my life. thanks to all of you and when i read this article again, 6 months ahead, ill probably reflect on this and see whether everything ended well. see yall again and thanks for the memories. back to the books.</p>
