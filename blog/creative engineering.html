  <h1>creative engineering?</h1>

  <p>joining crown ftc wasn’t just about robotics — it was about figuring out how to work like a team that actually moves. in ftc, you learn quickly that it’s not just building a robot, it’s building a system where everyone knows their role, and the robot is only one piece of the bigger puzzle.</p>

  <p>my role? part strategy, part hands-on build, part “make sure things don’t fall apart the night before the match.” i got to work on the hanging mechanism for our into the deep challenge, and that alone taught me more about problem-solving than any class ever could.</p>

  <p>things that stuck with me:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>⚙️ <strong>design is iteration:</strong> your first version will break. your second might too. keep going.</li>
    <li>🤝 <strong>teamwork is everything:</strong> one person’s great idea is nothing without others to back it up and make it real.</li>
    <li>📋 <strong>document as you go:</strong> future-you will thank present-you when the judges ask about your process.</li>
    <li>💡 <strong>adapt fast:</strong> something will go wrong on competition day — the best teams fix, not panic.</li>
  </ul>
<p>along with all of this, ending the season with the judges’ choice award was proof that the journey matters just as much as the results</p>
  <p>so what can i say..crown isn’t just a club — it’s where i learned that engineers can also be creative. also engineering is equal parts patience, chaos, and small wins that feel huge. and i’m here for every bit of it.</p>
  <p>but for now, check out the website i made for the team-<a href="crownftc.netlify.app">the website</a></p>
  <p>so here’s to the late nights, the last-minute fixes, and the moments when everything clicks. i’m ready for whatever comes next.</p>
  <p><i>see you in utopia.</i></p>
